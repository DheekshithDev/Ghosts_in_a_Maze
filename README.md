# Ghosts_in_a_Maze
This is a game project where the agent uses a modified A* (A-star) algorithm to find the best path in a 51x51 grid and traverses it to the end while avoiding ghosts that are stuck in the maze with him.
There are different agents with different abilities with each ability making the agent more efficient in winning the game by traversing the path and avoiding the ghosts better.
The whole animation for this game is implemented using pygame library in python.
